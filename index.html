    <p>Almost Simon is based on the original Simon electronic game, first developed in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>The original game device created a series of tones and light and required the player to repeat the sequence.</p>
    <p>As the player succeeded, the series became progressively longer and more complex.</p>
    <p>If the player made a mistake in the sequence, the game was over.</p>
